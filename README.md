# Collaborative Lint (COLINT)

This repository defines a robust linter for maintaining high-quality code standards across our project. 
Our linter leverages the power of several well-established tools:

- **Flake8**: Identifies and reports on various coding errors and stylistic issues.
- **Black**: Provides consistent code formatting by automatically reformatting code to adhere to standard style guides.
- **isort**: Ensures that imports are properly sorted and organized within each file.

### Additional Linting Features

In addition to the primary linting utilities, our linter performs the following checks:

- **Newline at End of Files**: Verifies that every file in the project ends with a newline character, ensuring compatibility with various tools and editors.
- **Cleaned Jupyter Notebooks**: Ensures that all Jupyter notebooks are free from any output or unnecessary metadata, keeping the notebooks lightweight and easy to review.

## Installation

Colint can be easily installed via `pip`. 
However, we **strongly** suggest you install `colint` in a separate environment from your production/development one.

### In a venv environment.

- Create a new environment using `venv`, and activate it.

  Example:
  ```sh
  python3 -m venv colint_env
  source colint_env/bin/activate
  ```

- Install `colint` in the new environment:

  ```sh
  pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/secomind/colint.git
  ```

### In a conda environment

- Create and activate a new conda environment.

  Example:
  ```sh
  conda create -n colint
  conda activate colint
  ```

- Install `git` and `pip` in the new environment.
  ```sh
  conda install git pip
  ```

- Install `colint`
  ```sh
  pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/secomind/colint.git
  ```

## Usage

The `colint` script provides several commands for maintaining code quality and cleanliness across Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

```
usage: colint [-h] [--check] [--clean-notebooks]
              command
              path_to_dir
```

### Positional Arguments
- **command**: Specify the command to execute. Options include:
  - `sort-libraries`: Sorts and organizes the library imports, it uses the `isort` library.
  - `code-format`: Formats the code according to defined style guides, it uses the `black` library.
  - `grammar-check`: Checks for and corrects grammatical/styling errors in code and docstrings, it uses the `flake8` library.
  - `newline-fix`: Fixes newline inconsistencies in the files.
  - `clean-jupyter`: Cleans Jupyter notebook files by removing unnecessary metadata and outputs.
  - `lint`: Performs all the above operations except `clean-jupyter`. To include `clean-jupyter`, use the `--clean-notebooks` flag.

- `path_to_dir`: Provide the path to the directory that needs linting.

### Options
- `-h`, `--help`: Show an help message and exit.
- `--check`: Enable check mode.
  In this mode, linting will not modify files; it will only check for issues.
- `--clean-notebooks`: Enable clean-notebooks mode.
  If the lint command is selected, this adds a procedure to clean Jupyter notebooks.
  If another command is used, this option has no effect.

### Examples

**Lint a Directory**
```sh
colint lint /path/to/your/project
```

**Check Code Format Without Modifying Files**
```sh
colint code-format /path/to/your/project --check
```

**Sort Libraries in Directory**
```sh
colint sort-libraries /path/to/your/project
```

**Clean Jupyter Notebooks and Lint**
```sh
colint lint /path/to/your/project --clean-notebooks
```

**Grammar Check**
```sh
colint grammar-check /path/to/your/project
```
